Scientific Machine Learning\nDeep neural networks and many other machine learning methods behave as a black box; Carefully curated inputs are fed into an opaque model whose internal parameters are tweaked until sufficient agreement with target observations is achieved. How can we marry our existing scientific knowledge with machine learning methods so as to not throw out what we have already characterized through rigorous experiment? Can we achieve higher model generalizability by utilizing scientifically informed constraints and learning strategies?"

Blanch green beans in batches in salted water for 3 minutes. Drain + cool beans and trim ends. In a pan, add EVOO and mushrooms and cook until brown. Reduce heat and add 4 tbsp of butter together with sliced herbs (it may be easier to do this step in two batches depending on your pan). Once finished remove mushrooms to a separate bowl. In the same pan, add remaining 2 tbsp of butter. Once melted, add in 2 tbsp of AP flour and whisk until golden & nutty forming a roux. Slowly begin to add milk, whisking to remove any clumps. Do the same with the cream forming a bechemel. Remove from heat and stir in cheese + garlic + pepper.\nMix together beans and mushrooms into a \\(9 \\times 13\\) baking dish. Drape the bechemel sauce over the top of the casserole. Cover with a sheet of aluminum foil. Bake 25-30 minutes covered until bubbling. Remove the foil and bake again until top is browned. Add a layer of French’s onions to the top of the casserole and bake again for 3-5 minutes until the onions are slightly darkened and fragrant."
