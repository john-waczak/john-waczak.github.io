The original version of the site was essentially my weekend dive into *building-websites-from-scratch*. I knew nothing about html, css, and javascript so I forced myself to write a simple webpage that I could host on github pages just for the sake of learning how websites are made. As it turns out, creating a website with a minimum amount of modern web sophistication is a moderately challenging task that I just don't have the time for. 

Fortunately there is a tool for this! Jekyll makes it incredibly easy to manage a personal website. I now can now write blog posts in markdown and they just show up with appropriate links and all of the right formatting. I no longer need to use my hacky combination of `pandoc` and html templates to convert simple posts to the right format. Also, *MathJax support comes out of the box* via kramdown. Here's an example: 

\begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega} d\alpha = \int_{\partial \Omega} \alpha 
\end{equation}

Going forward I plan to continue using this page to host blog posts about phsyics, math, and coding topics. Who knows, maybe I'll even try messing with javascript and `P5.js` to get some pretty animations going.
