How can we utilize (physics informed) machine learning techniques to cross achieve the maximum possible resolution in each of the categories? Can we infer reflectance spectra from an RGB image within a limited region and time window?"

Meanwhile, our autonomous boat directly measures physical and chemical water properties including temperature, salinity, turbidity, hydrocarbon concentrations, and chlorophylls. Can we use physics informed approaches to map the remote observations of the aerial vehicle to the direct observations of the boat?"

    "text": "4. Scientific Machine Learning\nDeep neural networks and many other machine learning methods behave as a black box; Carefully curated inputs are fed into an opaque model whose internal parameters are tweaked until sufficient agreement with target observations is achieved. How can we marry our existing scientific knowledge with machine learning methods so as to not throw out what we have already characterized through rigorous experiment? Can we achieve higher model generalizability by utilizing scientifically informed constraints and learning strategies?"
