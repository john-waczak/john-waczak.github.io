# UPDATE IN PROGRESS

# Post Ideas

- Recipes
- Stereogram generation project in rust
- Finite Element Analysis from scratch (1d, 2d, 3d)
- Conway's Game of Life
- General Machine Learning (going through PRML *from scratch*)
- Ray tracing and radiative transfer (in rust, modeled after `PBRT`)
- Physics and Differential Geometry
- Genetic Algorithms
- GPU computing in Rust/Julia
- Ising model simulations
- Random Sampling methods (including Metropolis-Hastings, Monte Carlo, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, etc...) [this could be a nice start](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02434)
- Visualizing the Lie Derivative
- Visualizing the Covariant Derivative
- Differentials that show up in Classical mechanics, e.g. $\delta$, $\partial$, $d$, $\nabla$, etc...
- Interpretations of quantum mechanics. Leonard Susskind had an interesting point about the Many Worlds interpretation: How many worlds are generated when a state like $\lvert \psi \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\lvert 1 \rangle + \frac{1}{2}\lvert 2 \rangle$ is measured? 3 worlds with $\lvert 1 \rangle$ and 1 world with $\lvert 2 \rangle$?
- Computed tomography 
- Sterogram generation (this would be a fun rust project to start)
