# UPDATE IN PROGRESS

# Post Ideas

- Recipes
- Stereogram generation project in rust
- Finite Element Analysis from scratch (1d, 2d, 3d)
- Conway's Game of Life
- General Machine Learning (going through PRML *from scratch*)
- Ray tracing and radiative transfer (in rust, modeled after `PBRT`)
- Physics and Differential Geometry
- Genetic Algorithms
- GPU computing in Rust/Julia
- Ising model simulations
- Random Sampling methods (including Metropolis-Hastings, Monte Carlo, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, etc...) [this could be a nice start](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02434)
