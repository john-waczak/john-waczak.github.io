![Me](/img/me.png )

I am a 3rd year graduate student studying physics at the University of Texas at Dallas.  I am working with [Dr. David Lary](https://davidlary.info/) to apply methods from machine learning to autonomous robotic teams for remote sensing of the environment. Check out our recent paper [here](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Autonomous-Learning-of-New-Environments-with-a-Team-Lary-Schaefer/ea0163b70d7ae858b2083336692350154ebceaa1) and [this](https://youtu.be/-VB3og5qmG0) great youtube video detailing the project. 

I have a wide variety of interests ranging from physics and mathematics to computation and machine learning. My plan is to use this site to detail the projects I'm working on as well as short blog posts about topics from math, physics, and machine learning.
