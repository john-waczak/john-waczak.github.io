Some project ideas: 

- Rust Projects
  1. Raytracing in Rust with parallelization and GPU support.
  2. Rendering code (from geometric primitives) from scratch.
  3. Scientific Plotting Code (in Rust)
- ML From Scratch (in Rust)
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Logistic Regression
  3. Decision Trees (CART)
  4. Random Forests 
  5. Boosted Trees
  6. Ensembling 
  7. Cross Validation
  8. Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization
  9. Clustering (Kmeans)
  10. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
  11. NMF, PMF, GTM, GSM
- Data visualization with D3.js
- Python Package using `uv` for NMF, GTM, GSM
- Reaction kinetics package a la `AutoChem`
- Discrete Differential Geometry processing (with ML applications) in Rust (with python bindings via `pyo3`)
